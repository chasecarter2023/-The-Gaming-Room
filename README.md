1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. 
Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a client that's looking to expand and build their current game "Draw it or lose it".
This is a puzzle-based game that is currently available only on Android OS. The objective of the game is to put together a 
picture like a puzzle. They are looking to build and fortify their current application. There are several things that they 
want to do such as build the software so that it is operational through all operating systems iOS, Linux, Windows, and mobile. 
They also need to build and choose the route of memory for the users and server via cloud-based. They also need to store the 
user's information thus needs a very strong security system that is in place for protection. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

Something that I think that I did well was showing the positives and negatives of all the operating systems. 
Also looking at different options that the developers could utilize when looking at which software to use for the different
operating systems. This took a considerable about of time due to the vastness of information that is available concerning 
different software for operating systems, and how they can be linked together.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The biggest aid in the design document was the overall outline that it provided to keep on track and not lose placement. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could pick one part to improve it would actually be what I think that I did well. Which is spending more time  
researching different software and finding out what new technologies are available currently. However, this takes a lot of time
learning what different software does and how it can be used is time-consuming. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the 
user’s needs when designing?

Considering the client's needs was the most important part of this project. The design is based on what the client's needs are.
They had some requested needs but also they had needs that they might not be fully aware for example security. Know what the
client's needs are help keep on task.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a 
similar software application?

The biggest thing for me when designing software would be the overall outline and trouble shooting problems. The outline keeps
me on task, and trouble shooting is something that I have difficult with. I think all developers have a hard time with 
trouble shooting problems, but overall programming is just that, solving problems!
